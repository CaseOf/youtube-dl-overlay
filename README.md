# Youtube-DLÂ automated Gentoo overlay

## Description

**WARNING**: This overlay is **experimental**.

This overlay is designed to offer latest stable Youtube-DL version as soon as possible.

For this to be possible, it is necessary that this overlay is automated.

A cron script is run every hour to update this overlay if a new version is available.

## Signature

Even if this repository is automated, commits are still signed.
When doing commits manually, my own PGP key is used.
When the script is committing new Youtube-DL versions, it signs with its PGP key.
